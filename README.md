# Introduction
Decentralised Digital Registry for the Blood Banks

# Context

People entering hospitals need some kind of blood transfusion everyday. Transfusions are needed to replace the blood of those suffering from cancer or other blood diseases and replenish blood lost in serious accidents.Once blood is collected, it needs to be preserved. As per the reports from Asia and Africa, there is a wastage of 20 % of blood collected. This happens due to incorrect procedures in transportation and storage. Currently there are no proper audits. For blood components, let us take a conservative estimate that only 25% blood is separated into components

# Constraints
- Instrumentation Issues in the devices used for blood irradiation.
- Background check of blood bank working staff
- Lack of resources in the blood bank for blood irradiation
- Lack of a common and collective shared database
- Lack of proper storage of blood components
- Decrease in blood availability
- Blood demand/supply mismatch
- High blood storage costs
- Blood obsolescence in 41 days
- Absence of a shared registry 
- Absence of a  common identification
- No exchange information system of blood banks

# Solution
- Donor profile can be linked to the blood bag through anonymous manner
- Blood Donation History can be verified on the Blockchain
- Donor can verify and validate the usage of blood in real time
- Exclusion of unsafe blood donors through transparent manner
- Blockchain can help track provenance in the blood supply line making it more transparent
- Blockchain can help to verify the credentials of the blood banks
- Blockchain can help to track the blood bags through encrypted QR codes
- Blockchain can help to validate the quality of the Blood Bank instruments

# Components
- Web App on ReactJS & NodeJS
- Blood Bank Data Verification on High Scalable Blockchain
- Blood Bank Data Encryption using Zero Knowledge Proofs 
- Blood Bank Donor Solution using Verifiable Randomness
- Blood Bank Data Collection using Interplanetary File System (IPFS)

# Benefits
- Bulk Blood Transfer 
- Better tracking of blood usage.
- Ensure blood availability for all the needy
- Provide a verifiable and effective system to check quality and expiry of blood.
- Provide real time information about blood products 
- Determine the cost-effective blood donation promotion system.
- Reduce cost of blood storage and management.
- Increase availability of rare blood types.
- Provide effective support for the less than shelf-life inventory strategy.
